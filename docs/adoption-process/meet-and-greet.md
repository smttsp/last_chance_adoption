# Initial Meet and Greet

This guide outlines how to handle visitors who are interested in our cats at the PetSmart adoption center.

## Setting Up the Area

Before visitors arrive:

- Ensure all cats have clean cages with fresh water and food
- Make sure all cats are wearing proper ID collars
- Keep the adoption area clean and welcoming
- Have adoption forms and pens readily available

## Greeting Visitors

When visitors approach the cat area:

1. Greet them warmly and introduce yourself as a Last Chance Animal Rescue volunteer
2. Ask if they're looking for a specific type of cat or just browsing
3. Offer to answer any questions about our cats or adoption process
4. Gauge their level of interest and seriousness about adoption

## Safety Protocols

Always follow these safety procedures:

2. Provide accurate information about:
   - Age
   - Medical history
   - Behavior with other pets/children
   - Special needs or requirements
3. Be honest about any behavioral issues or challenges
4. Allow visitors to interact with cats if appropriate:
   - For cats in cages, you may open the cage and allow petting
   - For socialization room cats, ensure door is secure before interaction

## Assessing Potential Adopters

While visitors interact with the cats, observe for:

- How they handle and speak to the cats
- Whether they ask appropriate questions
- Their expectations about cat behavior and care
