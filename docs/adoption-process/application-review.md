# Adoption Application Review

This guide explains how to review a Feline Adoption Request Form to determine if a potential adopter is a good match for a specific cat.

## When to Review Applications

- Review applications immediately after they're submitted when possible
- Take your time to carefully review all answers
- If other volunteers are available, discuss any concerning answers together

## What to Look For

### Red Flags

Watch for these common red flags that may indicate the adopter is not suitable:

- Plans to declaw the cat
- History of surrendering multiple pets without reasonable explanation
- Plans to keep the cat outdoors only
- Unstable living situation (e.g., moving soon, temporary housing)
- Allergies in the household that haven't been addressed
- Rental property with no confirmation of pet policy
- Inconsistent answers within the application
- Unwillingness to pay adoption fee

### Green Flags

Positive indicators that suggest a good potential adopter:

- Previous successful pet ownership
- Stable living situation
- All household members in agreement about adoption
- Realistic expectations about cat behavior and care needs
- Prepared for financial responsibility of pet ownership
- Indoor-only plans for the cat
- Knowledge about proper cat care

## Cat-Specific Considerations

For each cat, consider these specific matching factors:

### Kittens

- Homes with sufficient time for socialization and training
- Homes prepared for high energy and playfulness
- Adopters who understand kitten-proofing requirements

### Adult Cats

- Match personality to household activity level
- Consider cat's history with children/other pets

### Senior Cats

- Adopters who understand potential medical needs
- Quieter households for cats that prefer calm environments

### Special Needs Cats

- Adopters with ability and willingness to provide necessary care
- Previous experience with similar medical conditions (preferred)
- Financial ability to handle potential medical expenses

## Decision Process

After reviewing the application, decide on one of these outcomes:

1. **Approve**: Application meets all requirements and cat is a good match
2. **Needs More Information**: Application is promising but has missing or unclear information
3. **Deny**: Application has serious red flags or cat is clearly not a good match

For "Needs More Information" applications:
- Note specific questions on the form
- Speak with the adopter directly about concerns
- Check references if needed

## When to Deny an Application

Deny applications in these situations:

- Multiple serious red flags
- Pet would clearly be at risk
- Cat's needs and adopter's situation are incompatible
- False information provided on application

## How to Handle Denials

If you need to deny an application:

1. Be respectful and kind
2. Explain the primary reason for denial
3. Consider suggesting a more suitable cat if available
4. Avoid arguing or providing extensive explanations
5. Document the reason for denial in the "For Staff Use Only" section

## Approval Process

If the application is approved:

1. Mark "Approved" in the Staff Use Only section
2. Proceed to processing the adoption in the tablet system
3. Complete the remaining adoption steps

Remember, the goal is to find the right home for each cat, not just any home. It's okay to deny applications that aren't a good fit.
